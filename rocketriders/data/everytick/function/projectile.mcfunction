##Utility function for general projectile motion (used for Splashes)

#Initial teleport and position storage
execute at @s run tp @s ~ ~2 ~
execute store result score @s x run data get entity @s Pos[0] 1000000
execute store result score @s y run data get entity @s Pos[1] 1000000
execute store result score @s z run data get entity @s Pos[2] 1000000

#Teleport slightly forwards and store new position
execute at @s run tp @s ^ ^ ^0.001
execute store result score @s dx run data get entity @s Pos[0] 1000000
execute store result score @s dy run data get entity @s Pos[1] 1000000
execute store result score @s dz run data get entity @s Pos[2] 1000000

#Calculate differential
scoreboard players operation @s dx -= @s x
scoreboard players operation @s dy -= @s y
scoreboard players operation @s dz -= @s z

#Consider fall distance of nearest player to amplify vertical motion
execute at @s store result score @s FallDistance run data get entity @p[scores={ThrowSplash=1..}] FallDistance 150
scoreboard players operation @s dy -= @s FallDistance

#Store resultant motion
execute store result entity @s Motion[0] double 0.00075 run scoreboard players get @s dx
execute store result entity @s Motion[1] double 0.001 run scoreboard players get @s dy
execute store result entity @s Motion[2] double 0.00075 run scoreboard players get @s dz
data merge entity @s {NoGravity:0b}
